        <p><i>A samosa is a popular savory snack in many parts of the world, 
            particularly in South Asia. It consists of a crispy, deep-fried pastry shell filled with spiced potatoes, 
            peas, or meat. Often seasoned with a variety of spices, including cumin, coriander, and turmeric, 
            samosas are typically served with chutneys, such as mint or tamarind, adding a flavorful, 
            crunchy bite to any meal or occasion..

        <h2>Steps To Make Samosa</h2>
        <ol> 
        
            <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and transfer potatoes to a large bowl; mash coarsely, then set aside.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir onions, coriander seed, curry powder, ginger, salt, turmeric, cumin, allspice, cayenne pepper, and cinnamon in hot oil until onion is lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove the skillet from heat and stir in tomatoes and peas. Pour into coarsely mashed potatoes and mix until thoroughly combined. Cool filling completely.</li>
            <li>Cut each pie crust into 8 equal triangles. Spoon filling onto the wide end of each triangle; fold corners over filling to create a triangle-shaped hat. Pinch dough together to form a seal. Brush beaten egg whites over each samosa and arrange on baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until samosas are golden brown, about 15 minutes.Enjoy!</li>
